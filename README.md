A Generic and flexible system for NTC based constant temperature anemometers

## Introduction

The idea here is to develop a system where different types of NTC thermistors can be used in the same systems. It is meant to emulate research type constant temperature anemometry systems (such as the one described by Itsweire, 1983). This anemometer will include a decade resistance, square wave generator and resistance measurement.

Besides its use as an anemometer itself, it will help me to understand the inner workings of a CTA and the components of the system. From this project, I will try to develop a system as described by Itsweire (1983).
